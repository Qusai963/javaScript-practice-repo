# What is the object is JS?
 - In JavaScript, objects are one of the most important and flexible data types. They are used to store collections of data and functions and are essentially containers that can hold other data types and objects.

- In JavaScript, an object is defined using a set of key-value pairs, where the key is a string (or Symbol) that acts as a unique identifier for a property, and the value can be any JavaScript data type or object.
